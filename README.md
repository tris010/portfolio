## 📦 Deployment (Vercel)

The easiest way to check the live version is to use Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftris010%2Fportfolio)

### Manual Deployment Steps

1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login.
2. Click **"Add New"** > **"Project"**.
3. Select this repository (`tris010/portfolio`).
4. Click **"Deploy"**.
5. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and build the site.

### 🌐 Customizing the URL (Professional Domain)

To change the default `.vercel.app` URL to something more professional:

1. Go to your **Vercel Dashboard** -> Select this Project.
2. Click on **Settings** -> **Domains**.
3. **Option A (Free):** Click "Edit" on the default domain and change it to `avani-khemka.vercel.app` (or similar).
4. **Option B (Recommended):** Buy a custom domain (e.g., `avanikhemka.com`) from GoDaddy/Namecheap and add it here. Vercel will guide you through the DNS setup.
